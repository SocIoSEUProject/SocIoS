So this concept is quite personal for me to talk about so I'll spare you the details but what I really wanted to portray is that feeling when you really need to face the facts and stop pretending. There are certain aspects in my life that are a great representation of this idea. Some things have happened that I'm not happy about, that I hate talking about and facing, but there comes a time when you need to in order to move forward. This week I've realised that and I know it'll be hard, but it needs to be done. Things are changing and often that's hard to deal with, but in the end, it needs to be faced. So, today I went outside and sprayed water in my face for a good two hours, haha. 

In other news I'm obsessed with Taylor Swift's new song &quot;Begin Again&quot; and I'm on my one week break so yay! 

P.S. I experimented with editing with this photograph too - I hope you like it :) | 0.286sec

[Sep Sun 16 12:50:17:911] GetStringSentiment returned I am breaking my new rule and posting mid week.... It is a sketch I did back in Dec 2010, just after my Nanna past into glory. This book of hers (given to her from her mother in 1942 when she was 27) was given to me. It is a daily devotional book and on the weekend I saw in on my shelves and thought I should start reading it so imagine how nice it was to see that  Adebanji Adeola Alade (an amazing artist in London) posted a quote from it today on facebook,
‎&quot;He was better to me than all my hopes;
He was better than all my fears;
He made a bridge of my broken works,
And a rainbow of my tears.&quot;- Streams in The Desert

Please also check out this- a sketch of my first bible that I was given from my Nanna and Pa and that I drew in memory of her the day after she died.

[Sep Mon 17 17:14:16:772] GetStringSentiment returned The last formal interview given to a journalist by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto took place on 10th August, 1977, just over a month after his overthrow and 33 days before his arrest, imprisonment, trial and execution on 4th April, 1979.

The journalist was Inam Aziz, who with Habibur Rehman, had been invited from London to meet Zia-ul-Haq. Inam Aziz, one of Pakistan’s great campaigning editors, was a known admirer of ZAB, which should have made him a persona non grata in the military government’s book, but those were early days and the regime was still trying to find its feet. On 8th August, Inam was in Lahore, the day ZAB landed to a welcome whose like the city had not accorded to anyone since Liu Shao-chi. While milling crowds were escorting Bhutto, who had just been released from “protective custody,” to Nawab Sadiq Hussain’s residence, Maulana Shah Ahmed Noorani, who was on his way to the airport, was waylaid, pulled out of his car, roughed up and made to shout ‘Jiye Bhutto’ by exuberant PPP workers.

Inam Aziz recounted his meeting with ZAB in Stop Press , a little-noticed but fascinating autobiography. During the Zia years, it was only his London-based Urdu daily Millat that continued to denounce military rule. It is another matter that when the PPP came to power, men like Inam Aziz found themselves banished from the camp of victory, but that is another story for another day. What follows is Inam Aziz’s recollection of ZAB’s last recorded interview.

He was taken to see Bhutto by Maulana Kausar Niazi. Bhutto with his photographic memory recognised Inam, greeting him by name, though he had only met him a couple of times. Inam presented Bhutto with a box of Havana cigars, one of which Bhutto lit up. The interview had barely begun when there was a phone call for Bhutto in the next room. When he returned fifteen minutes later, he was fuming. When Inam asked who had called, Bhutto said, “It was Zia and he threatened to kill me. I have told him that if I survive, I will have him and 35 of his generals hanged for treason.” After some time Bhutto said, “He held me responsible for the manhandling of Noorani. This is the first time he has been impertinent with me. When he came to see me in Murree, he could not stop ‘sirring’ me. Today there was arrogance in his voice.” When Inam remarked that Zia’s threat should be taken seriously, Bhutto drew at his cigar and said, “I am not afraid of death. I am a man of history and you cannot silence history.”

When Inam quoted Zia as saying that he would hold elections in 90 days and transfer power, Bhutto smiled, “You expect these people to hold elections! Don’t expect liars to speak the truth.” When Inam told him that Zia had cited God as a witness to his pledge to hold free and fair elections, Bhutto remarked, “That’s another of his lies. I have just told you about my conversation with him, so you can decide for yourself if there will ever be elections in this country.” When Inam asked him about his fall, Bhutto smiled and said, “To tell you the truth, I chose the wrong advisers. I have come to hate members of this pseudo-intellegensia who received favours from me but have now joined hands with the army.” On the rigging charge, he said he had not ordered it and only seven constituencies may have been involved.

Bhutto told Inam about the inquiry he had ordered into the rigging and the resulting 10-page report of which the army had a copy. The investigation had found that the American government was heavily involved in the post-election unrest. Hundreds of millions in PL-480 funds were spent to fuel the protest movement. In some mosques mullahs had been found with dollars. During the agitation, as soon as someone was injured, opposition parties would arrive on the scene and begin doling out money. The American embassy was orchestrating the effort. He added that the US embassy had been told that the government had evidence of American meddling and would like a meeting on the issue with the Secretary of State. Some days later, the US embassy replied that Secretary of State Cyrus Vance would be in Paris for a NATO meeting and a representative could be sent to meet him.

The cabinet chose Aziz Ahmed, who arrived in Paris with the evidence. The meeting with Rogers took place at the American embassy, but whenever Aziz Ahmed would try to raise the issue of American interference, Rogers would tell him that the US and Pakistan being old friends, what had happened in the past should not impede the resumption of good relations. Whenever Aziz Ahmed would try to open his briefcase to reach for the documents he was carrying, Rogers would stop him and assure him that Pakistan would have no further cause for complaint. After the meeting, Aziz Ahmed left his briefcase with Ambassador Muzaffar Ali Qizalbash for safekeeping. When he returned to his hotel after attending a reception, he found his room vandalised. He called the manager who expressed shock and astonishment. Since Aziz Ahmed knew who his “visitors” had been, he decided against approaching the police. “Do you realise now what a clash with a big power can involve?” Bhutto asked Inam.

When Inam asked Bhutto what would happen if elections were held in 90 days, he replied that all the waderas and zamidars would be wiped out and even he would be finished as a wadera , but if the people felt that he would meet their aspirations, they would not reject him. When Inam asked him why the army was only able to stage coups in Pakistan and not in India, Bhutto replied that 85 per cent of the army comes from the Punjab, as does the bureaucracy. When the two join hands, political forces become helpless. He conceded that political forces, in order to protect their interests, often become tools in the hands of this army-civil combine. When Inam rose to take his leave, Bhutto said, “If you learn when you return to London that I am still alive, come back and we will meet.” When Inam replied that if Bhutto returned to power, people like him would not be able to get to see him, Bhutto replied, “I don’t think this time things are going to be like that.”

Bhutto, of course, never regained power and Inam Aziz died in London in 1993. | 1.412sec

Subject: Nikon D800 + Nikkor 135mm f2 DC

Just couldn't resist shooting a portrait of my portrait lens :)

Wanted to test the high ISO performance on the RX100. This was shot at ISO3200 -- looks like pretty aggressive noise-reduction going on in-camera, but the effect is pretty good. I can notice it in the bokeh but the detail (esp. in the crinkly parts of the D800's shell) is well preserved. | 0.279sec

I'll make the final fold a couple of weeks later, once my exams are over. There are also other models I have to fold along with this too XD
The only thing I think I gotta work on is the eyes and antennae, which is something where I have always suffered XD | 0.277sec

Subject: Nikon D800 + Nikkor 135mm f2 DC

Just couldn't resist shooting a portrait of my portrait lens :)

Wanted to test the high ISO performance on the RX100. This was shot at ISO3200 -- looks like pretty aggressive noise-reduction going on in-camera, but the effect is pretty good. I can notice it in the bokeh but the detail (esp. in the crinkly parts of the D800's shell) is well preserved. | 0.28sec

I'll make the final fold a couple of weeks later, once my exams are over. There are also other models I have to fold along with this too XD
The only thing I think I gotta work on is the eyes and antennae, which is something where I have always suffered XD | 0.284sec

Regarding the current video, you can enjoy Kylie's classic song "On A Night Like This", two wonderful versions combined into one! The right side version is from 2005 (Showgirl Tour, London), while the left side version is from one year later (2006, Showgirl Homecoming Tour). What makes it very special, that in 2005 Kylie had breast cancer, and her 2006 concert was after her successful medical treatments. Links: | 0.292sec

[Sep Mon 24 16:55:13:274] GetStringSentiment returned This soundscape was commissioned as part of Beyond the Torch Run. It was composed by musician Simon Wood, using the sounds he collected on Seaford beach with families from Seaford Downs Syndrome and Special Needs Support Group. It's aim is to capture the things that children notice when exploring the beach. This was done through play and a participation workshop. Simon has spun these sounds together to form a rhythmic soundtrack emulating the ebb and flow of the tide, and the crashing of waves, interspersed by the sounds of children and those using the beach. The video montage was edited by Kristina Veasey to become a visual reflection of the soundscape, Beyond the Torch Run is a community engagement project by artist and Paralympian Kristina Veasey, that brings together art and the spirit of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England. It has also been granted the prestigious Inspire mark by the London 2012 Inspire programme. It's principal aim is to celebrate the diverse and unique landscapes between Seaford and Lewes. This soundscape has been just one part of the project. For more info on other aspects of the project, and to participate through the interactive map please go to www.beyondthetorchrun.co.uk To hear music by Simon Wood please visit myspace.com/simonwood21 or myspace.com/siglo21band | 0.299sec

[Sep Mon 24 17:32:03:151] GetStringSentiment returned This soundscape was commissioned as part of Beyond the Torch Run. It was composed by musician Simon Wood, using the sounds he collected on Seaford beach with families from Seaford Downs Syndrome and Special Needs Support Group. It's aim is to capture the things that children notice when exploring the beach. This was done through play and a participation workshop. Simon has spun these sounds together to form a rhythmic soundtrack emulating the ebb and flow of the tide, and the crashing of waves, interspersed by the sounds of children and those using the beach. The video montage was edited by Kristina Veasey to become a visual reflection of the soundscape, Beyond the Torch Run is a community engagement project by artist and Paralympian Kristina Veasey, that brings together art and the spirit of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. It is supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England. It has also been granted the prestigious Inspire mark by the London 2012 Inspire programme. It's principal aim is to celebrate the diverse and unique landscapes between Seaford and Lewes. This soundscape has been just one part of the project.

The series primarily centres on the residents of Albert Square, a Victorian square of terraced houses, and its neighbouring streets, namely Bridge Street, Turpin Road and George Street, and which encompasses a pub, street market, night club, community centre, charity shop, cafe and various small businesses, in addition to a park and allotments. The series was originally screened as two half-hour episodes per week. Since August 2001, four episodes are broadcast each week on BBC One, with each episode being repeated on BBC Three at 22:00 and an omnibus edition on BBC One at weekends. From 1985 to 2012 the omnibus aired on Sunday afternoons, but was moved to a Friday night/Saturday morning slot from 6 April 2012.[2][3] It is one of the UK's highest-rated programmes, often appearing near or at the top of the week's BARB ratings. Within eight months of its launch, it reached the number-one spot in the ratings, and has consistently remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. The average audience share for an episode is currently between 35 and 45 percent. Created by producer <b>...</b> | 0.285sec

[Sep Sun 30 12:55:49:995] GetStringSentiment returned A Conservative Party Conference 2012 'special'.

Not much to explain really: the Conservatives are a party of lies and liars. Something which is easily demonstrated but too many seem not to have either; noticed, realised, accept the obvious truth, or, simply dont care. Some it would seem, think that lying repeatedly and often is perfectly acceptable even when it puts a party into government that has no business or even a right to be there. 

Lies on the NHS, lies on welfare, lies on the unemployed, the sick and the disabled. Lies about tax, lies on expenses, lies on Leveson, even lies about pasties.... on and on. 

The Tories it seems follow a trend noted by the Nazi propagandist and master liar Joseph Goebbels, who claimed that; &quot;the English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.” The Tories indeed seem less concerned with being called upon their various lies - perhaps due to a seemingly correct assumption of widespread apathy or gullibility? | 0.396sec

[Oct Tue 2 15:41:16:214] GetStringSentiment returned Friday October 5th 2012 Students from Beal Secondary School in London Walked out in support for teachers and against Bill 115. About 80-100 students walked out of class in support of the teachers and to build solidarity amongst students. This is a positive sign, and seeing this in addition to General Assemblies starting up at Western give many in the activist community hope that we are building a strong network of solidarity and spreading the anti-austerity agenda. Law 115 is taking away our teachers rights & affecting the student body & all extracurricular activities! This law will effect everything from class sizes, supplies, field trips.. Also this bill takes away any leverage the teachers have to collectively bargain hence the only choice teachers have is to stop extra-curricular activities from the school year. The government says this law is "necessary"... ~mike r Pictures: www.facebook.com Filmed by Mike Roy and Curtis Nixon Edited by Mike Roy Recorded in London, Ontario Canada (Oct 5th 2012) The Indignants (Media group) Twitter: @theindignants www.theindignants.org http Media Co-op (Media group) www.mediacoop.ca www.mediacoop.ca Occupy Toronto Media www.facebook.com www.occupyto.org | 0.53sec

[Oct Tue 2 15:41:24:136] GetStringSentiment returned The Heron Tower is a skyscraper in the City of London, the financial and historic centre of London. Upon completion in 2011 it became the tallest building in the City.
The tower is owned by Heron International and stands 230 m tall including its 28 m mast (202 m excluding the mast) making it the third tallest in Greater London, after the Shard and One Canada Square at Canary Wharf.
It is located at No. 110 Bishopsgate, occupying the block between Houndsditch and Camomile Street. It is bounded to the west by Outwich Street.

Designed by architects Kohn Pedersen Fox, the height of the Heron Tower was planned to be 183 m, identical to that of Tower 42, the City of London's then tallest building.
It attracted some controversy when first announced due to its proximity to St Paul's Cathedral when viewed from Waterloo Bridge. English Heritage was notably vocal in expressing concerns. A public inquiry was subsequently held, the outcome of which was decided by deputy prime minister John Prescott, who ruled in the developers' favour. The tower was given final approval for construction in July 2002.
Three years later, the project had yet to begin construction. In September 2005 the Heron Property Corporation submitted a planning application to increase the height of its approved building. Heron's revised plans now proposed a 202-metre (663 ft) tall tower topped by a 28-metre (92 ft) mast, giving it a total height of 230-metre (755 ft). Although the design was largely identical to the previous scheme, the tower's crown and southern façades were refined. In January 2006, the revised project was approved by the City of London Corporation. | 0.348sec

[Oct Tue 2 15:41:30:796] GetStringSentiment returned Tower 42 is the second tallest skyscraper in the City of London and the seventh tallest in Greater London.[1] The original name was the National Westminster Tower, having been built to house the National Westminster Bank's International Division. Seen from above, the tower closely resembles the NatWest logo (three chevrons in a hexagonal arrangement).[2]
The tower, designed by Richard Seifert and engineered by Pell Frischmann, is located at 25 Old Broad Street. It was built by John Mowlem &amp; Co between 1971 and 1980, first occupied in 1980, and formally opened on 11 June 1981 by HM Queen Elizabeth II.[3]
The construction cost was £72 million (approximately £230 million today).[4] It is 183 metres (600 ft) high, which made it the tallest building in the UK until the topping out of One Canada Square in the Docklands in 1990. It held the status of tallest building in the City of London for 30 years, until it was surpassed by the Heron Tower in December 2009. | 0.299sec

[Oct Tue 2 15:41:45:047] GetStringSentiment returned Bell Busk signal box located by the Up Main line at the south end of Bell Busk station

Bell Busk signal box was a Midland Railway type 2b design which opened on 18th June 1899, replacing as 1870s-built signal box located slightly to the north. A replacement frame of 20 levers was installed on 10th January 1909 and the signal box closed on 19th December 1971 when the absolute block section was extended to between Gargrave and Hellifield signal boxes

The signal box carries a London Midland and Scottish Railway post-1935 design nameboard and by the locking room door is a holder for three fire buckets occupied by a lone bucket

[Oct Tue 2 15:41:52:732] GetStringSentiment returned Until the beginning of the nineteenth century and although for thousands of years a truly 'multi-cultural' city, Delhi was largely unknown to Europeans. Too far away from the coast for the Portuguese and too aristocratic and tumultuous for even the East India Company, it maintained - even after yet another devastating sacking and looting in the late 18th century -   a haughty Asiatic aloofness.  The first couple of intrepid Scottish adventurers who arrived there after a long and difficult journey up almost the full length of the Ganges took to its oriental exoticism like ducks to water and managed – much to the disapproval  of their former  colleagues and brother officers - to install themselves pasha-style in various of the decaying palaces left over from the decadent remnants of the Great Mughals. But apart from a few fascinating rumours and the cautious arrival of a British military contingent,  nothing much more was heard of Delhi before the so-called Indian Mutiny of 1857  when it proved to be a focus for native resistance and so a serious threat to the encroaching British Raj. With Queen Victoria taking the  liberty of proclaiming herself Empress of all India, Delhi became a sort of Northern Indian military headquarters, facing the forbidding and perilous approaches from Central Asia and from where the real opposition was likely to come:  the Red Fort was entered and despoiled,  the last enfeebled Mughal cornered in the sacred tomb of his ancestor and exiled to Burma and the British took possession, impervious to the former glories, scandalised by the habits of the inhabitants and disgusted at the by-then squalid ruins. In 1911 it was decided to move the  Indian capital to Delhi from Calcutta.  A considerable task faced the planners and architects; what the British called Old Delhi and the native population Sharjahanabad, was just the most recent of at least seven earlier cities, the remains of which lay littered about over a large area. A faint idea of how it would still largely have appeared can be derived from first-hand accounts at the time and from a few illustrations by Thomas Daniell  a hundred years earlier.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_buildings_at_Firoze_Shah_Kotla,_Delhi.jpg" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_buildings_at_Firoze...</a> 

An ambitious, and in a way mad or anyway madly ambitious, scheme to build a completely new city was envisaged on more or less vacant and scrubby land a few kilometres south of the former one.  What population existed was shunted off to nearby Paharganj, alongside the proposed New Delhi  Railway Station, presumably then a minor village and today a frantic mecca for the less sedate type of tourist though not without traces of a picturesque past. The terrain is drab and  as flat as a pancake, but a single slight elevation, Raisina Hill, was chosen for a monumental construction intended symbolically but deliberately to impress and subdue. Edward Lutyens, previously a highly original but somewhat arty architect who hadn't quite found his niche in his native surroundings, was initially given the job, to which he rose with remarkable imagination until his grandiose plans were hindered by a rival, Herbert Baker. Lutyens wanted a great ceremonial avenue – at least twice as long and wide as the Champs Elysées - leading from India Gate to a Vice-regal palace approached by a 'ramp' to crown Raisina Hill, but he was persuaded, or obliged,  to re-design it simply to lead over the horizon so that the enormous palace,  re-named after 1947 as the  Rashtrapati Bhavan, remains invisible until a much closer approach. This photograph shows a little more than half of one side of a square
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indian_President_House.jpg" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Indian_President_House.jpg</a> 

Its most notorious resident, Lady Edwina Mountbatten, is said to have complained that it wasn't big enough; the first President of the new Indian Republic was so ashamed at the ostentation that he used only one wing, as all his successors have done.  For all that, it must rate as one the finest pieces of 20th century architecture anywhere. What is visible, all the way along the magnificent Rajpath, are these also enormous so-called Secretariat Buildings according to the designs of Baker and symmetrically lining the final stages of the avenue, less original and less successfully mixing    Classical columning, Baroque domes, municipal clock towers, Napoleonic fountains and so on, all transported willy-nilly to an incongruous setting, but still very imposing and impressive and on a Pharaonic scale although their function was always, as now, entirely administrative. The  echoing marbled interiors emulate cathedrals, rather like St Paul's in London stripped of the trappings of Anglican Christianity.  The colossal labour required utilised only the most traditional methods, flimsy scaffolding of little more than sticks and string, thousands of blocks of stone cut, chiselled and fitted by hand and all the material carried on human backs, as it always had been, except that perhaps the most amazing thing is that all this was going on less than a hundred years ago. At the same time, the equally immense labour of constructing the double circus of Connaught Place was in progress, a continuous circular sequence of identical white colonaded terraces with broad radiating avenues of many miles of 'bungalows'  (now amongst the most desirable and costly of urban residences) evoking the elegancies of Nash's incompleted Regency London and similarly doomed to run out of money. During the First War the subjects of George V were not happy at forking out for the extravagances of a distant city few of them would ever see while their own were being reduced by the  terrible cost of a conflict they hadn't asked for. By the time New Delhi was more or less completed in 1931 the British were  running out of steam as well as cash  and their end in India was already foretold.  They occupied their city  for hardly longer, and at no less cost, than the medieval Tughluqs, making the same mistake, did theirs: there's a saying  that to erect such an invasive stronghold is to invite a vengeful and speedy reprisal from djinns teeming in the ancient Delhi atmosphere.  The buildings remain as great monuments regardless of their intentions, austerely elegant, ingenious and beautiful in design and just about as solid as the pyramids. Should anything at all last for a few more centuries, New Delhi will be revered as an historical and architectural show-piece amongst whatever takes its place.

I'm not the only less conventional visitor  to notice the striking parallels in conception between Old and New Delhi, separated by several centuries and ostensibly expressing completely different 'cultural values' and religious and philosophical viewpoints   The common ingredient is sheer overwhelming force disguised behind a very fine aesthetic eye, the urge for empire building concealed as benevolence. This photograph of the Red Fort from 1905, just before New Delhi was thought of, conveys a shadowy impression of a representation of imperial power waiting to be imitated
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Fort,_Delhi.jpg" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Fort,_Delhi.jpg</a> 

Perhaps it would be exaggerated to call the red stone, common to both, somewhat bloodthirsty, but nor would anyone describe it as gentle, and the effect is certainly to imply the hint of a threat as well as to give elemental substance to the more fastidious white detailing it supports or encloses,  rather in the manner of the great fortresses of Rajasthan concealing exquisite pleasure palaces atop impregnable bastions . But whatever the concessions to decorative details, neither city is 'Indian'. It's a difference not just of bulk but grace; rigid symmetrical order in place of the meandering impulsive  line enhanced by rich and exuberant ornamentation, and  a refusal to budge for momentary diversion.

[Oct Tue 2 15:41:59:016] GetStringSentiment returned A Conservative Party Conference 2012 'special'.

Not much to explain really: the Conservatives are a party of lies and liars. Something which is easily demonstrated but too many seem not to have either; noticed, realised, accept the obvious truth, or, simply dont care. Some it would seem, think that lying repeatedly and often is perfectly acceptable even when it puts a party into government that has no business or even a right to be there. 

Lies on the NHS, lies on welfare, lies on the unemployed, the sick and the disabled. Lies about tax, lies on expenses, lies on Leveson, even lies about pasties.... on and on. 

The Tories it seems follow a trend noted by the Nazi propagandist and master liar Joseph Goebbels, who claimed that; &quot;the English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.” The Tories indeed seem less concerned with being called upon their various lies - perhaps due to a seemingly correct assumption of widespread apathy or gullibility? | 0.35sec

[Oct Tue 2 15:42:06:026] GetStringSentiment returned Several cows in the centre of Derry/Londonderry have been damaged by vandals - The fibreglass creatures made up part of a herd on display in a so called &quot;Cow Parade&quot;. 

The cows had been decorated by various groups and individuals, and several had only just recently been moved from Ebrington Square to Guildhall Square and an adjacent park. Two cows in the tiny park had holes smashed in them. Whilst the cow pictured was extensively damaged, damage to the udder cow was less severe; it just appeared to be badly grazed. 

It was also notable that on one of the cows, which was decorated with an image of all places named Derry and Londonderry throughout the world, the word &quot;London” had been removed from the Londonderry in Northern Ireland.

Another Dairy/Londondairy saga if you like..

Finally - a quick call to the parades commission revealed that no notification of any cow parade had been received by them, but a spokesman said that any such request would likely have been rejected as the parade would most probably have passed close to an area occupied by sheep, and as such could have been deemed contentious. | 0.309sec

&quot;Debt crisis: S&amp;P slashes eurozone growth forecasts - 
The eurozone will not start to grow until at least 2014, according to forecasts by Standard &amp; Poor's, as the rating agency said it now expected Spain's economy to contract by 1.4pc next year. &quot;
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/debt-crisis-live/9564009/Debt-crisis-SandP-slashes-eurozone-growth-forecasts-live.html" rel="nofollow">The Telegraph Online  - 2012.09.25</a>

&quot;(Christine) Lagarde (IMF managing director) warned that American politicians need to act responsibly because overly aggressive spending cuts alongside ballooning debt could send the U.S. into another recession. 
She raised concerns over whether the global economy could handle another few months of U.S. inaction as it inches closer towards the fiscal cliff.
&quot;If it had to, it would suffer,&quot; says Lagarde. &quot;The bottom line: it means less growth, less jobs, and the economy of the United States is the largest economy in the world. It has links to the rest of the planet. So it would be bad for the U.S., but it would be bad for the global economy, as well.&quot;

&quot;Crisis de la deuda: S &amp; P recorta previsiones de crecimiento de la eurozona en vivo -
La eurozona no empezará a crecer al menos hasta 2014, según las previsiones de Standard &amp; Poors, ya que la agencia de calificación dijo que ahora espera que la economía de España se contraiga el próximo año 1.4%. &quot;

&quot;(Christine) Lagarde (director gerente del FMI) advirtió que los políticos estadounidenses tienen que actuar de manera responsable, porque los recortes de gastos excesivamente agresivos junto con la creciente deuda podría enviar a los EE.UU. a una nueva recesión. Ella expresó su preocupación sobre si la economía mundial podría manejar unos meses de inactividad de EE.UU. mientras éste se acerca cada vez al precipicio fiscal.
&quot;Si tuviera que hacerlo, sufriría&quot;, dijo Lagarde. &quot;El resultado final: significa menos crecimiento, menos empleo y la economía de los Estados Unidos es la economía más grande del mundo, que tiene vínculos con el resto del planeta, por lo tanto, sería malo para los EE.UU., pero sería malo para la economía global, también. &quot;

<b><i>&quot;... Y ante los ojos de la gente ese es el fracaso, y ante los ojos de los hambrientos hay una ira creciente. En las almas de las personas las uvas de la ira se están llenando y haciendo cada vez más fuertes, cada vez más pesadas para la cosecha. &quot;</i></b>

Having said that it will cost Netherlands €22bn. Lemme show how Nederland will manage to Repress Domino Effect (Cross Your Fingers. It’s an Experiment):The collapse of the eurozone would not only cause a major recession in the Netherlands, but would cost the country hundreds of billions of euros in lost assets, according to a new report by ING economists. In total, the cost to the country would be €339bn, of which banks' finances would contract by €111m and the government's by €121bn, the ING report said. If rather than a total collapse, Greece left the eurozone instead, the impact on the Dutch economy would be around €22bn. Manageable Of this, the government would have to write-off €17.75bn and the private sector the rest. ‘That will hurt, but it does not have to lead to insurmountable problems for the country,’ the report said. ‘So at first sight, a Greek withdrawal would be manageable.’ However, ‘the biggest problem would be that a Greek pull-out could trigger a domino effect,’ the report concluded. The best option for the eurozone crisis is to ensure the survival of the euro, but it is impossible to say how much that would cost the country, the report said.Aside from all-that-jazz

&quot;Debt crisis: S&amp;P slashes eurozone growth forecasts -

&quot;(Christine) Lagarde (IMF managing director) warned that American politicians need to act responsibly because overly aggressive spending cuts alongside ballooning debt could send the U.S. into another recession. 
She raised concerns over whether the global economy could handle another few months of U.S. inaction as it inches closer towards the fiscal cliff.
&quot;If it had to, it would suffer,&quot; says Lagarde. &quot;The bottom line: it means less growth, less jobs, and the economy of the United States is the largest economy in the world. It has links to the rest of the planet. So it would be bad for the U.S., but it would be bad for the global economy, as well.&quot;

Having said that it will cost Netherlands €22bn. Lemme show how Nederland will manage to Repress Domino Effect (Cross Your Fingers. It’s an Experiment):The collapse of the eurozone would not only cause a major recession in the Netherlands, but would cost the country hundreds of billions of euros in lost assets, according to a new report by ING economists. In total, the cost to the country would be €339bn, of which banks' finances would contract by €111m and the government's by €121bn, the ING report said. If rather than a total collapse, Greece left the eurozone instead, the impact on the Dutch economy would be around €22bn. Manageable Of this, the government would have to write-off €17.75bn and the private sector the rest. ‘That will hurt, but it does not have to lead to insurmountable problems for the country,’ the report said. ‘So at first sight, a Greek withdrawal would be manageable.’ However, ‘the biggest problem would be that a Greek pull-out could trigger a domino effect,’ the report concluded. The best option for the eurozone crisis is to ensure the survival of the euro, but it is impossible to say how much that would cost the country, the report said.Aside from all-that-jazz

About 80-100 students walked out of class in support of the teachers and to build solidarity amongst students. This is a positive sign, and seeing this in addition to General Assemblies starting up at Western give many in the activist community hope that we are building a strong network of solidarity and spreading the anti-austerity agenda. Law 115 is taking away our teachers rights & affecting the student body & all extracurricular activities! This law will effect everything from class sizes, supplies, field trips.. Also this bill takes away any leverage the teachers have to collectively bargain hence the only choice teachers have is to stop extra-curricular activities from the school year.

Your criticism was that the Occupy message was "so general as to be undemanding" and that "I just feel we've got to do a bit better than that". I would like to respond.Back in 1848 a huge crowd gathered on Kennington Common on the edge of my parish. They were for the third time about to petition parliament to demand electoral reform. It was the final throw of the dice. Chartism had run its course.Throughout the previous decade the Chartists had been written off by those with political power. Thomas Carlyle described them as "wild inarticulate souls ¦ unable to speak what is in them". What is this? This is an experiment in virtual agent news production.

It is filmed on location at St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, City of London Guildhall, Finsbury Square and other historic sites of the Occupy protest. The song tells the story of the betrayal of the St Paul's protestors by the religious establishment together with the City of London authorities, both with financial and political interests: By Bishopsgate I pitched my tent 'Neath St Paul's my Sunday school And fateful shadows in the night There comes a priest called Muffin the Mule. For Faith you faithless tell me lies Bishop, you who took their gold And did the man from Galilee Weep tears for every truth you sold? Chorus: London, oh you cut my heart Judas friend of guile and schemes Grave of my innocence, Mammon town Of angels, whores, and shame and dreams. Lord Mayor by the Dean is blessed Goldman Sachs in bright array So the wretched deal is done And Pilate's churchmen prophets slay. And in Glencoe upon Wren's yard The Corporation thieves the morn Campbell knife in darkness falls With boots and lies and blood and scorn. And now my darling in my arms Soaring breasts so pure and cool Cairo sunshine in your hair We sing farewell to Muffin the Mule. www.guardian.co.uk | 0.299sec

[Oct Tue 2 16:35:13:221] GetStringSentiment returned Friday October 5th 2012 Students from Beal Secondary School in London Walked out in support for teachers and against Bill 115. About 80-100 students walked out of class in support of the teachers and to build solidarity amongst students. This is a positive sign, and seeing this in addition to General Assemblies starting up at Western give many in the activist community hope that we are building a strong network of solidarity and spreading the anti-austerity agenda. Law 115 is taking away our teachers rights & affecting the student body & all extracurricular activities! This law will effect everything from class sizes, supplies, field trips.. Also this bill takes away any leverage the teachers have to collectively bargain hence the only choice teachers have is to stop extra-curricular activities from the school year. The government says this law is "necessary"... ~mike r Pictures: www.facebook.com Filmed by Mike Roy and Curtis Nixon Edited by Mike Roy Recorded in London, Ontario Canada (Oct 5th 2012) The Indignants (Media group) Twitter: @theindignants www.theindignants.org http Media Co-op (Media group) www.mediacoop.ca www.mediacoop.ca Occupy Toronto Media www.facebook.com www.occupyto.org | 0.293sec

&quot;Debt crisis: S&amp;P slashes eurozone growth forecasts - 
The eurozone will not start to grow until at least 2014, according to forecasts by Standard &amp; Poor's, as the rating agency said it now expected Spain's economy to contract by 1.4pc next year. &quot;
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/debt-crisis-live/9564009/Debt-crisis-SandP-slashes-eurozone-growth-forecasts-live.html" rel="nofollow">The Telegraph Online  - 2012.09.25</a>

&quot;(Christine) Lagarde (IMF managing director) warned that American politicians need to act responsibly because overly aggressive spending cuts alongside ballooning debt could send the U.S. into another recession. 
She raised concerns over whether the global economy could handle another few months of U.S. inaction as it inches closer towards the fiscal cliff.
&quot;If it had to, it would suffer,&quot; says Lagarde. &quot;The bottom line: it means less growth, less jobs, and the economy of the United States is the largest economy in the world. It has links to the rest of the planet. So it would be bad for the U.S., but it would be bad for the global economy, as well.&quot;

&quot;Crisis de la deuda: S &amp; P recorta previsiones de crecimiento de la eurozona en vivo -
La eurozona no empezará a crecer al menos hasta 2014, según las previsiones de Standard &amp; Poors, ya que la agencia de calificación dijo que ahora espera que la economía de España se contraiga el próximo año 1.4%. &quot;

&quot;(Christine) Lagarde (director gerente del FMI) advirtió que los políticos estadounidenses tienen que actuar de manera responsable, porque los recortes de gastos excesivamente agresivos junto con la creciente deuda podría enviar a los EE.UU. a una nueva recesión. Ella expresó su preocupación sobre si la economía mundial podría manejar unos meses de inactividad de EE.UU. mientras éste se acerca cada vez al precipicio fiscal.
&quot;Si tuviera que hacerlo, sufriría&quot;, dijo Lagarde. &quot;El resultado final: significa menos crecimiento, menos empleo y la economía de los Estados Unidos es la economía más grande del mundo, que tiene vínculos con el resto del planeta, por lo tanto, sería malo para los EE.UU., pero sería malo para la economía global, también. &quot;

Obama &amp; Cameron gaily Cheered: “Yes! We Did It” Fuck Greek Exit. It Costs Eurozone $1T only. What Coldblooded Mutha Fuka Huh. Both Fools are Conspiring that those Jump-the-Ship-Assets Spirited outta Greece condensate in New York &amp; London Secret Societies Bankruptcies than offshored or evaporate in Swiss banks as fleeing China Corrupt CCP members doing. Having said that it will cost Netherlands €22bn. Lemme show how Nederland will manage to Repress Domino Effect (Cross Your Fingers. It’s an Experiment):The collapse of the eurozone would not only cause a major recession in the Netherlands, but would cost the country hundreds of billions of euros in lost assets, according to a new report by ING economists. In total, the cost to the country would be €339bn, of which banks' finances would contract by €111m and the government's by €121bn, the ING report said. If rather than a total collapse, Greece left the eurozone instead, the impact on the Dutch economy would be around €22bn. Manageable Of this, the government would have to write-off €17.75bn and the private sector the rest. ‘That will hurt, but it does not have to lead to insurmountable problems for the country,’ the report said. ‘So at first sight, a Greek withdrawal would be manageable.’ However, ‘the biggest problem would be that a Greek pull-out could trigger a domino effect,’ the report concluded. The best option for the eurozone crisis is to ensure the survival of the euro, but it is impossible to say how much that would cost the country, the report said.Aside from all-that-jazz

&quot;Debt crisis: S&amp;P slashes eurozone growth forecasts - 
The eurozone will not start to grow until at least 2014, according to forecasts by Standard &amp; Poor's, as the rating agency said it now expected Spain's economy to contract by 1.4pc next year. &quot;
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/debt-crisis-live/9564009/Debt-crisis-SandP-slashes-eurozone-growth-forecasts-live.html" rel="nofollow">The Telegraph Online  - 2012.09.25</a>

&quot;(Christine) Lagarde (IMF managing director) warned that American politicians need to act responsibly because overly aggressive spending cuts alongside ballooning debt could send the U.S. into another recession. 
She raised concerns over whether the global economy could handle another few months of U.S. inaction as it inches closer towards the fiscal cliff.
&quot;If it had to, it would suffer,&quot; says Lagarde. &quot;The bottom line: it means less growth, less jobs, and the economy of the United States is the largest economy in the world. It has links to the rest of the planet. So it would be bad for the U.S., but it would be bad for the global economy, as well.&quot;

&quot;Crisis de la deuda: S &amp; P recorta previsiones de crecimiento de la eurozona en vivo -
La eurozona no empezará a crecer al menos hasta 2014, según las previsiones de Standard &amp; Poors, ya que la agencia de calificación dijo que ahora espera que la economía de España se contraiga el próximo año 1.4%. &quot;

&quot;(Christine) Lagarde (director gerente del FMI) advirtió que los políticos estadounidenses tienen que actuar de manera responsable, porque los recortes de gastos excesivamente agresivos junto con la creciente deuda podría enviar a los EE.UU. a una nueva recesión. Ella expresó su preocupación sobre si la economía mundial podría manejar unos meses de inactividad de EE.UU. mientras éste se acerca cada vez al precipicio fiscal.
&quot;Si tuviera que hacerlo, sufriría&quot;, dijo Lagarde. &quot;El resultado final: significa menos crecimiento, menos empleo y la economía de los Estados Unidos es la economía más grande del mundo, que tiene vínculos con el resto del planeta, por lo tanto, sería malo para los EE.UU., pero sería malo para la economía global, también. &quot;

<b><i>&quot;... Y ante los ojos de la gente ese es el fracaso, y ante los ojos de los hambrientos hay una ira creciente. En las almas de las personas las uvas de la ira se están llenando y haciendo cada vez más fuertes, cada vez más pesadas para la cosecha. &quot;</i></b>

Obama &amp; Cameron gaily Cheered: “Yes! We Did It” Fuck Greek Exit. It Costs Eurozone $1T only. What Coldblooded Mutha Fuka Huh. Both Fools are Conspiring that those Jump-the-Ship-Assets Spirited outta Greece condensate in New York &amp; London Secret Societies Bankruptcies than offshored or evaporate in Swiss banks as fleeing China Corrupt CCP members doing. Having said that it will cost Netherlands €22bn. Lemme show how Nederland will manage to Repress Domino Effect (Cross Your Fingers. It’s an Experiment):The collapse of the eurozone would not only cause a major recession in the Netherlands, but would cost the country hundreds of billions of euros in lost assets, according to a new report by ING economists. In total, the cost to the country would be €339bn, of which banks' finances would contract by €111m and the government's by €121bn, the ING report said. If rather than a total collapse, Greece left the eurozone instead, the impact on the Dutch economy would be around €22bn. Manageable Of this, the government would have to write-off €17.75bn and the private sector the rest. ‘That will hurt, but it does not have to lead to insurmountable problems for the country,’ the report said. ‘So at first sight, a Greek withdrawal would be manageable.’ However, ‘the biggest problem would be that a Greek pull-out could trigger a domino effect,’ the report concluded. The best option for the eurozone crisis is to ensure the survival of the euro, but it is impossible to say how much that would cost the country, the report said.Aside from all-that-jazz

German Chancellor Angela Merkel made her first visit to Greece since the eurozone crisis began here three years ago. Her five-hour stop is seen by the government as a historic boost for the country's future in Europe's shared currency, but by protesters as a harbinger of more austerity and hardship.

[Oct Wed 3 14:22:03:047] GetStringSentiment returned Friday October 5th 2012 Students from Beal Secondary School in London Walked out in support for teachers and against Bill 115. About 80-100 students walked out of class in support of the teachers and to build solidarity amongst students. This is a positive sign, and seeing this in addition to General Assemblies starting up at Western give many in the activist community hope that we are building a strong network of solidarity and spreading the anti-austerity agenda. Law 115 is taking away our teachers rights & affecting the student body & all extracurricular activities! This law will effect everything from class sizes, supplies, field trips.. Also this bill takes away any leverage the teachers have to collectively bargain hence the only choice teachers have is to stop extra-curricular activities from the school year. The government says this law is "necessary"... ~mike r Pictures: www.facebook.com Filmed by Mike Roy and Curtis Nixon Edited by Mike Roy Recorded in London, Ontario Canada (Oct 5th 2012) The Indignants (Media group) Twitter: @theindignants www.theindignants.org http Media Co-op (Media group) www.mediacoop.ca www.mediacoop.ca Occupy Toronto Media www.facebook.com www.occupyto.org | 0.303sec

Your criticism was that the Occupy message was "so general as to be undemanding" and that "I just feel we've got to do a bit better than that". I would like to respond.Back in 1848 a huge crowd gathered on Kennington Common on the edge of my parish. They were for the third time about to petition parliament to demand electoral reform. It was the final throw of the dice. Chartism had run its course.Throughout the previous decade the Chartists had been written off by those with political power. Thomas Carlyle described them as "wild inarticulate souls ¦ unable to speak what is in them". What is this? This is an experiment in virtual agent news production.

It is filmed on location at St Paul's Cathedral, the Bank of England, City of London Guildhall, Finsbury Square and other historic sites of the Occupy protest. The song tells the story of the betrayal of the St Paul's protestors by the religious establishment together with the City of London authorities, both with financial and political interests: By Bishopsgate I pitched my tent 'Neath St Paul's my Sunday school And fateful shadows in the night There comes a priest called Muffin the Mule. For Faith you faithless tell me lies Bishop, you who took their gold And did the man from Galilee Weep tears for every truth you sold? Chorus: London, oh you cut my heart Judas friend of guile and schemes Grave of my innocence, Mammon town Of angels, whores, and shame and dreams. Lord Mayor by the Dean is blessed Goldman Sachs in bright array So the wretched deal is done And Pilate's churchmen prophets slay. And in Glencoe upon Wren's yard The Corporation thieves the morn Campbell knife in darkness falls With boots and lies and blood and scorn. And now my darling in my arms Soaring breasts so pure and cool Cairo sunshine in your hair We sing farewell to Muffin the Mule. www.guardian.co.uk | 0.313sec

BUT seeing 20000 people waving at the same time directed by George was SO impressive... and I couldn't resist recording the new visuals, very good, even though the old ones were my favourite and I personally loved that incredible cosmic sunset, I think they were the best visuals in the concert already before. George singing his dazzling no-presentation-needed "PRAYING FOR TIME" (1990, album "Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1"), live at at Earls Court One in London during the rescheduled concert on Sunday, the one before the last "SYMPHONICA" next Wednesday. Although he was not very chatty tonight (a shame!), George's voice was impressively good, on top form. He also seemed to be in a great mood. And the energy from the crowd was exhilarating. I was lucky to be rather near the stage this time so I enjoyed it even more tonight, a completely different experience. I don't like arenas or big stadiums, where the experience for the unfortunate ones far away from the stage is not nearly as good and personal, but the atmosphere tonight was SO electrifying, and it was incredible to see first hand how this man directs a whole super huge venue like this either on their feet, dancing, or doing the wave together when he asks them, or renders them adoringly silent when required for the ballads: Sold out, it was AROUND 20000 PEOPLE there, completely surrendered to his magic, absolutely everybody as far as the eye could see <b>...</b> | 0.324sec

[Oct Wed 17 13:42:38:336] GetStringSentiment returned Yes, it is a fact I am obsessed with mixing the perfect greys- warm grey, neutral and the right blue grey. 

So that is the focus of this new minimal palette I am trying (refer to previous posts to find out more) and rather than doing elaborate neat (what is that word?) colour charts, I prefer just to practice mix the colours in my palette and doing a swipe of paint on the page. The emphasis is getting into the right mixing habit, how much paint to pick up and in what order, and how to adjust a mix on the palette. Therefore the colours are all from the one mix but testing different variations and ratios of colour etc. Having trouble matching a blue grey with what I am used to*... But I am happy for (and needing) a change. 
*  mixed from WN Cobalt Deep Blue and Daniel Smith Burnt Quin Orange... My  personal gourmet version of the standard French ultramarine and burnt sienna

BTW these are done in my specific colour sketchbook – I REALLY love having this separate book and find it so useful to re-visit different exercises.
I am going out sketching tomorrow (all being well) and it is going to be my first out with this minimal set. | 1.168sec

[Oct Sat 20 16:20:43:561] GetStringSentiment returned Dozens of Muslims in London come together for a protest. But they say their protest is quite different because it promotes the message of Islam in a better way in a society like Britain. Held by Muslims, angry at the offensive video against Islam, but also disappointed with the response to it. This is the second rose demo 27 year old Sara has organized. This event was organized online. Not by any particular group or organization. It is a grass roots event. Those who have handed out each of these 3500 roses today hope it will be a small gesture that makes a big change. A change in perception and a change of heart for those who view and represent Islam in the wrong way.

Her Majesty suggested the financial crisis of 2008 had happened because the Financial Services Authority "didn't have the teeth" to rein in the biggest risk-takers. The Duke of Edinburgh, meanwhile, had a typically blunt piece of advice for the Bank's executives: "Don't do it again!" The Queen and the Duke grilled Bank of England staff during a visit which included a tour of a vault stacked with £27 billion worth of bullion. Sujit Kapadia, one of the Bank's financial policy experts, said he wanted to answer a question the Queen asked academics at the London School of Economics in 2008 about why no-one saw the financial crisis coming. | 1.485sec
