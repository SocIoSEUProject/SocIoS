  "description": "The Egyptian capital Cairo was the scene of violent chaos on Friday, when tens of thousands of anti-government protesters stoned and confronted police, who fired back with rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons. It was a major escalation in what was already the biggest challenge to authoritarian President Hosni Mubarak's 30 year-rule. They are demanding Mubarak's ouster and venting their rage at years of government neglect of rampant poverty, unemployment and rising food prices.

The information Nina is sharing here comes from an Asahi Shimbun Newspaper article about the situation in Egypt. Nina saw the picture in the newspaper and asked about it and her mother explained the content of the article to her in Japanese. Then, the next day, Nina saw a similar picture in my English newspaper and started to explain what she had learned in English, so I grabbed my video camera. We are flattered by all the kind comments, but just wanted to set that record straight.",
