DotNetNuke

For more details please see the DotNetNuke Installation Guide (downloadable from dotnetnuke.com)

Prerequisites
-------------
DotNetNuke requires .net 3.5 SP1 (or higher) to be installed.

Clean Installation
------------------
- .NET Framework 2.0 must be installed (.net 3.5 SP1 is recommended as a future version of DotNetNuke will require this)

- unzip package into C:\DotNetNuke (note: the install package is the most commonly used, the source package is intended for those who wish to make core changes or debug through the source)

- the website user account must have Read, Write, and Change Control of the root website directory and subdirectories ( this allows the application to create files/folders and update it¡¯s config files), This account is different depending on the version of the OS/webserver, please see the list below for the correct account
 - If using Windows XP Professional - IIS5.1 this is the  {Server}\ASPNET User Account. Note: Windows XP can be configured to run using simple security. By default it is turned off in Windows XP Professional when it joins a domain, but if running standalone you will need to disable it to access the more detailed file sharing dialog. See http://duxcw.com/faq/win/xp/simpshare.htm for more details.
 - If using Windows 2003 (IIS6), Windows Vista (IIS7) or Windows 2008 (IIS7) this is the NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE User Account.
 - If using Windows 2008 R2 (IIS 7.5) or Windows 7 (IIS7.5) this is the IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool User Account.

- create Virtual Directory in IIS called DotNetNuke which points to the directory where the DotNetNuke.webproj file exists )

- make sure you have default.aspx specified as a Default Document in IIS

- The install version needs no other changes, but if you use the source version rename release.config -> web.config

- Note: SQL Server 2005, 2008 / SQL Express 2005, 2008 all supported.
  - manually create SQL Server database named "DotNetNuke" ( using Enterprise Manager or your tool of choice )
  - make sure you grant sufficient database permissions (db_owner is commonly used)
  - set the connection string in web.config in TWO places ( ie. <add key="SiteSqlServer" value="Server=(local);Database=DotNetNuke;uid=;pwd=;" /> )

- browse to localhost/DotNetNuke_Community (or whatever you have used for your url) in your web browser

- the application will automatically execute the necessary database scripts and provide feedback in the browser

Application Upgrades

- BACKUP your web.config file in the root of your site

- unzip the code over top of your existing application ( using the Overwrite and Use Folder Names options )

- browse to localhost/DotNetNuke_Community (or whatever you have used for your url) in your web browser
